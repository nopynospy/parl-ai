To create a social media chatbot for countering hate speech, where a classifier first detects if a text is toxic. If it is toxic, reply with the Emphathetic model, else reply with the Tweeter model.

# Research Questions
1.	What are the limitations faced by current state of the art natural language processing tools in handling toxic comments?
2.	How could a safer dialogue utility be designed and implemented?
3.	What are the suitable methods and metrics in evaluating the safety performance of a dialogue utility?
